**Kpet: Animal Feeder Robot**

Kpet is an intelligent animal feeding robot designed to provide food for geese, ducks, and cats. The robot uses the YOLO neural network for real-time object detection, allowing it to accurately recognize and classify different animals before dispensing the appropriate amount of food.

**Features**:

- Animal Recognition: Utilizes YOLO (You Only Look Once) neural network to detect and classify animals, specifically targeting geese, ducks, and cats.

- Automated Feeding System: Once an animal is identified, Kpet activates a feeding mechanism to distribute food automatically.

- Mechanical System on Raspberry Pi: The full mechanical system runs on a Raspberry Pi, managing the classification model and the feeding operation.

**Technologies**:

- Neural Network: YOLO for real-time animal detection and classification.

- Hardware: Raspberry Pi to control mechanical components and run the classification algorithm.

Kpet aims to make animal care more efficient, particularly for outdoor animals, by automating feeding and ensuring each animal receives the right food, effectively combining machine learning with robotics.
